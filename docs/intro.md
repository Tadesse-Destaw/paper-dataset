# Introduction to the EA-MT Task

Welcome to the Entity-Aware Machine Translation (EA-MT) Task documentation. This project focuses on the challenge of correctly translating named entities in machine translation.

## What is Entity-Aware Machine Translation?

Entity-Aware Machine Translation (EA-MT) is a specialized form of machine translation that pays particular attention to how named entities (people, places, organizations, creative works, etc.) should be properly translated between languages. 

Unlike regular words, named entities often have specific translations in different languages that can't be derived through literal translation. For example:
- "Little Women" (a book/movie) translates to "Mujercitas" in Spanish
- "A Room of One's Own" (a book) translates to "Una habitaci√≥n propia" in Spanish
